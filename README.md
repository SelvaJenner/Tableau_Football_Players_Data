2. Analyze the year-wise total number of players who joined FIFA to understand the growth and popularity of the sport.
3. Use treemaps to visualize the distribution of skilled moves based on players' preferred playing foot.
4. Calculate the average age of players and identify the top 5 countries with the youngest players to identify emerging talent.
5. Determine the number of players whose contracts are expiring in 2020 to assist in player recruitment and transfer decisions.
6. Create a storyboard with three story points: a) Body type-wise distribution of players, b) Position-wise average wages and highest-paid position, and c) Visualization of the average value of players and wages over the years using a dual-axis graph.

Tools used: Tableau for data visualization and analysis, and Excel or any other spreadsheet software for data manipulation and calculations.
